tableOfContents: In which a house is built at Pooh Corner for Eeyore -- In which Tigger
  comes to the forest and has breakfast -- In which a search is organized, and Piglet
  nearly meets the Heffalump again -- In which it is shown that Tiggers don't climb
  trees -- In which Rabbit has a busy day, and we learn what Christopher Robin does
  in the mornings -- In which Pooh invents a new game and Eeyore joins in -- In which
  Tigger is unbounced -- In which Piglet does a very grand thing -- In which Eeyore
  finds the Wolery and Owl moves into it -- In which Christopher Robin and Pooh come
  to an enchanted place, and we leave them there.
